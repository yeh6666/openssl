The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade ,full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation.

Please remember that export/import and/or use of strong cryptography software,

providing cryptography peafjmfpmg hooks, or even just communicating technical details about cryptography software is illegal in some parts of the world. So when you import this package to your country, re-distribute it from there or even just email technical suggestions or even source patches to the authors or other people you are strongly advised to pay close attention to any laws or regulations which apply to you. The authors of openssl are not liable for any violations you make here. So be careful, it is your responsibility.

OpenSSL is a a collaborative effort of a worldwide community of volunteers that has a code of conduct.

Here are some of the ways you can join the community and contribute. The list of development team members is available, as is a description of how to  contact us off-line. We'd also like to thank several groups for help with the project infrastructure over time.

We maintain several mailing lists. Anyone can join, but you must be a member of a list to post to it. We have a public wiki, and anyone can request an account and start adding content. We have a team blog, where members of the development team will occasionally post.

While we only distribute source, some members of the community make binaries available.

Reporting Bugs

If you think have found a security bug, please see our  vulnerabilities page for information on how to report it.

We have set up a request tracker at  https://rt.openssl.org, with read-only access using guest as the name and password. Requests can be viewed on-line by using the following URL, replacing NNNN with the request number: https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=NNNN

To report a bug or make an enhancement request, send email to rt@openssl.org. In the subject line, please make sure to indicate if it's a bug or a fix, and a brief description of the issue. In the body of your mail, please include the versions of the operating system and OpenSSL you are using. If you have a patch or diff, please send it as an attachment, and not inline in the message body.

The easiest way to respond to an existing request is to reply to the relevant message in openssl-dev@openssl.org. To help avoid duplicate copies, edit the recipient list so that only rt@openssl.org is listed and remove any quoted material.

You can also create a pull request in  GitHub, but if you do that, please also use RT and refer to the request number. That way we are less likely to lose track of things.
